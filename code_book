This is the code book for tidy_data.txt, which contains the tidy data set generated by R script run_analysis.R.

Study Design
  The raw data is from getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip, which is downloaded from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
  The raw data is proccessed by following the 5 steps instruction discribed in course project 
of the Cousera course Getting and Cleaning Data.
  All the proccessing details are in the run_analysis.R script file.

Observations and Varaible Details
  The tidy data set has 180 observations. Each observation is for  each subject and each activity. 
Since we have 30 subjects and 6 activities, we get 30*6 = 180 observations. 
  The tidy data has 68 variables. The first two are "subject" and "activity". For the other 66 ones, each is
mean of a selected measurement values for  each subject and each activity. The selecting rules is only 
the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each original measurement from the sensor (check the 
getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip for details).  


Data Dictionary tidy_data.txt
==========================================================================================================
"subject" 2
  type integer, range 1:30
  identifies the subject who performed the activity.
  
"activity" 18
  factors, 6 levels: LAYING SITTING STANDING WALKING WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  activities the person performed.

The following 66 variables' dictionary can be referenced in the features_info.txt and feature.txt files in the
getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip. But they are a bit difference from the varaibles in feature.txt, 
because I have eliminated the "()" and replaced "-" with "." for tidy reasons.
